  description: "The cookies in this module are practically identical to real cookies,
    but if you dunk these ones in milk, you\u2019ll explode.\r\nThis manual was originally
    written by the winner of a short manual-writing competition held in the KTaNE
    Discord (which was me, by the way ;D).\n\nThis is a reupload of EpicToast's module
    with changes and bug fixes. Unsubscribe from the old version here:\r\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613360570\n\n[url=https://ktane.timwi.de/HTML/Cookie%20Jars.html]Manual
